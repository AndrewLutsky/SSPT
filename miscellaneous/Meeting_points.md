Meeting points (10-8-23):

- we will be careful in using github so no work is lost

(11-12-23)

- Just implemented the 2d visualizations (merged with the algorithm) and got decent plots for the 5 test protein seqs.
- Not sure how to show the beta bends as they are scattered throughout the sequence, and not just surrounding sheets.
- Next, working on overlaying the predictions as colors on pdb file of an actual protein.
